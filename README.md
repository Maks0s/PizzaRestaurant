### Clean architecture separation:
- Domain layer includes:
   - Pizza entity on which all standard CRUD operations are performed;
   - AuthUser entity which is used for identity
- Application layer includes:
   - All CQRS stuff related to entities;
   - All expected errors: Auth, Pizzas, Data manipulation, and Validation;
   - Behaviors for general logging and model validation;
   - Interfaces of services;
- Infrastructure layer includes:
   - All persistence related stuff:
      - Repository
      - DbContexts
      - Migrations
   - Implementation of JWT generation and configuration
- Presentation layer in—Åludes:
   - DTO's;
   - Mapping logic;
   - Controllers:
      - Errors controller for unexpected problems
      - Base controller for overridden logic
      - Entities controllers for CRUD and auth

Each layer contains its own DependencyInjection file with registration and configuration of all related services.
